# Portal, an app to connect volunteers and NGO's based on mutual interest

The idea behind the app is to connect interested volunteers and NGOs. The key to establishing this link is the *interest*.
A volunteers would only be interested if NGOs are working on a field that would utilize their skill set and help them improve it better.
Similarly, NGOs would be interested to work with volunteers who has the necessary skills and suitable area of interest. 

The application runs over the web and has register/ login + Dashboard features.
